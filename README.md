# Indium
Adaptation of Indigo (Reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API) for use with Sodium. Currently requires bleeding-edge builds of the Sodium [1.16.x/next branch](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric#bleeding-edge-builds-unstable). (my fork is no longer necessary)

Based heavily upon [Indigo](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.16/fabric-renderer-indigo) (licensed Apache 2.0)
